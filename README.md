# Learning Svelte 5

This project is my journey to learn about the new features in Svelte 5.

## About the Project

I created this project to explore and understand the new features introduced in Svelte 5. This includes understanding the new syntax, the new lifecycle methods, and how to effectively use them in a Svelte project.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/learning-svelte-5.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## What I Learned

I primarily wanted to build a project that leveraged the new runes and signals. Through my journey I learned the Observer Pattern, the power of Signals, Compile Time Reactivity vs Runtime Reactivity, and Local Storage. I have tried to iron out all the bugs, so please report any issues if you find any.
